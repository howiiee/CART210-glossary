# Digitization:

Digitization is a process or a creation of a physical object that becomes photographed, processed into the computer using descriptive coding and then fully becomes a digital media that can be viewed across any search engine.[^mallison23digitization] Digitization entails any physical object or in-person sound that was scanned or recorded and uploaded to a computer to then be showcased within the digital realm. By digitizing data and services, it allows things like energy transformation, mobility and logistic sectors, and enhanced health care to be possible.[^kagermann15digitization] 

An example of digitization is taking a photo with a camera of something and then uploading it onto the computer to edit it, just by uploading it or scanning it, within the computer the image is being hardcoded to now be a digital image able to be manipulated unlike the actual object itself. Another example can be written text as well as typewritten text when written on the computer turns the process digital. The process of converting music from a VHS tape and making it into an LP or video is also a form of digitization. Digitization ultimately becomes the idea that all the analog elements as well as physical elements that are then hardcoded into a computer using ones and zeros are now a digitized version of them.[^bloomberg18digitization]
