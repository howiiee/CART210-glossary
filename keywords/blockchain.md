## Blockchain

A blockchain is a shared and public ledger that stores data and is used to record transactions accross multiple computers. This database has a continuously growing list of information/records called blocks which are linked through cryptography. Every block stores a hash, history of the previous block, transactional data, date and time.[^berg18blockchain]

Blockchains are secure and maintain a decentralized record of transactions which is the reason they are used for (although not limited to) cryptocurrencies. There is no way to change a block therefore making it very safe and removes the need of third parties for transfers.[^kulhari18blockchain]

For example, blockchains are used in the monetary world for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum since it ensures transparency between transactions and protects the financial identity of individuals when they use crypto to buy or sell anything.[^segura23blockchain]
