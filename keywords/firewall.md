A firewall is like a security gate that controls what comes in and out. It is a network security device that monitors the incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block them based on a set of defined security rules. 
There are different types of firewalls, such as proxy, stateful inspection, UTM, next-generation, cloud-native firewalls and more, each with different features and functions. [^Cisco24firewall]

A firewall has many benefits, such as blocking spyware, stopping virus attacks, promoting privacy, and network traffic, and preventing hackers from accessing the network. [^Spiceworks24firewall]
