## Open Source

Open source refers to software with source code made accessible to the public to view, modify, and distribute. It centers around community collaboration, the importance of peer review, and process transparency. [^osi01Wiki] Open source software is typically available for no charge and prevents entities from having total market control over source code. [^diffingo02Wiki]

Software sharing was integral throughout software’s early history, but as software became less tied to specific hardware and more monetizable, proprietary software became more appealing to companies. The free software movement arose in response to this through important figures such as Richard Stallman. With ambiguity surrounding the word “free”, the idea of open source was proposed. [^producingOSS03wiki] The history of the free software movement and the open-source-software movement are closely interlinked but remain separate movements. 

Some popular examples of open source software include the Linux operating system, the Mozilla Firefox browser, and LibreOffice.
