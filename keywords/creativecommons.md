## Creative Commons

In an easy way to understand, Creative Commons is basically a fancy law regarding copyright. Essentially, why Creative Commons are so particular is because they are a more globally known copyright law which easier to use and more common. In simple terms, when an author uses Creative Commons on his work he's allowing users/readers to reuse their work on another.[^Harington20creativecommons] Moreover, the praticality of Creative Commons is also really important to know.
