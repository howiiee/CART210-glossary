## Cultural Determinism

Cultural determinism is a theory that bases our emotions and behaviors upon the culture in which we are raised. It suggests that cultural and social influence dominate biological behavior. Breaking the theory down into two concepts, culture is the sum of attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another; while determinism is a philosophical position whereby an event has conditions that could not be caused by any other means.  [^feenberg10CD]

Cultural determinism may not be all determinant, however. Often we are pressured into following cultural norms without understanding or recognizing those norms. As long as the culture’s coercion remains unconscious, there are few opportunities to act outside of those norms. But it’s not entirely unusual for a person to become aware of their cultural coercion, and act in a different way. [^ketner71CD] Would this resistance to cultural expectations also be a culture-bound decision?
