## Ransomware

Ransomware is a specific class of malware that demands a payment (usually in the form of [cyrptocurrency](../main/glossary.md#crytocurrency)) in exchange for a stolen functionality. The phenomenon first appeared around 2005, and indidents have only increased. Most ransomwares “make an intensive use of file encryption as an extortion means"[^Gazet10RW]. Often, the ransomeware encrypts various files on victim’s hard drives before asking for a ransom to get the files decrypted. 

There are 4 more major types of ransomware:[^Razaulla23RW] 
1. Crypto: encrypts data important to victims
2. Locker: locks victims out of their systems
3. Scareware: tricks users into buying or downloading malicious software, often through startling messages
4. Leakware: threatens to make users data public unless a ransom is paid

In 2023, ransomeware payouts totaled over $1.1 billion USD from an estimated 4,399 different attacks - the most costly year ever, twice as much as the year before. However, only 29% of ransomware victims in the final quarter of 2023 paid the demanded ransoms - a significant drop from years before, where 70-80% were paid, which suggests more lucrative targets are being selected for attacks. Close to 75% of ransomeware payouts top the million dollar mark.[^Greenberg24]
