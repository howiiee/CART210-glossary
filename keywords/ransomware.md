## Ransomware

Ransomware is a specific class of malware that demand a payment in exchange for a stolen functionality. The phenomenon first appeared around 2005. Most ransomwares “make an intensive use of file encryption as an extortion means… they encrypt various files on victim’s hard drives before asking for a ransom to get the files decrypted.” [^Gazet10RW]

There are 4 more major types of ransomware: crypto (encrypts data important to victims), locker (locks victims out of their systems), scareware (tricks users into buying or downloading malicious software, often through startling messages), and leakware (threatens to make users data public unless a ransom is paid).
