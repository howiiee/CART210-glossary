## Codec

A "codec," which stands for "coder-decoder" or "compressor-decompressor," is a type of technology primarily used in digital media for encoding and decoding audio and video streams. The primary purpose of a codec is to compress large multimedia files to reduce their size for more efficient storage and faster transmission over networks, which is particularly vital in applications like webcasting, video conferencing, and online streaming.

Codecs work by compressing (coding) a media file when it is saved or transmitted and then decompressing (decoding) it for playback or editing. This process involves removing redundant or unnecessary data, and in some cases, data that is less perceivable to human senses, such as inaudible sounds in audio (as seen in MP3 codecs). The level of compression can vary, with some codecs prioritizing higher compression rates to save on bandwidth and storage, while others focus on retaining higher quality with less compression.

Different codecs are optimized for specific types of data. For instance, some are tailored for human speech, making them ideal for voice calls or audio books, while others are designed for high-fidelity music or complex video sequences[^kerdranvat20codec]. The effectiveness of a codec is a balance between the processing power required for compression and decompression, and the level of compression achieved. More efficient codecs that achieve higher compression rates typically require more processing power, which can be a consideration for devices with limited computational resources.

The development and evolution of codecs have played a pivotal role in shaping the handling of multimedia on the Internet[^chen18codec]. For example, the introduction of the MP3 format revolutionized the music industry by allowing for the easy digital distribution of music, albeit raising significant copyright issues. Similarly, advancements in video codecs, such as AV1, HEVC, and AVC, have significantly impacted online video streaming, providing high-quality video at lower bandwidths.

In the realm of visual arts, the artistic exploration of codecs is exemplified by German artist Thomas Ruff's JPEGs series. Starting in 2002, Ruff used digital photographs taken by himself and from the web, compressed using the maximum rate, and then decompressed into large-scale prints. This method of hypercompression and enlargement highlights the mathematical infrastructure of the JPEG image, exposing the pixel blocks into which the image is split during the compression process. Ruff's work turns a digital artifact (pixelation) into a default aesthetic, reflecting how JPEG has become the modern default mode of viewing images online and on-screen. This illustrates a shift from geometric projection to algorithmic processing in image creation, emphasizing that 'photographic' now denotes a specific mode of image processing, with the mathematical matrix used during compression as the new 'architectural order' of the image[^hoelzl13codec].

The ongoing innovation in codec technology, including the development of both proprietary and open-source variants, continues to be integral to enhancing multimedia experiences on the Internet. This is especially evident in the increasing demand for codecs that can provide high video compression efficiency in the face of rising video data traffic, balancing the need for quality, bandwidth availability, and processing capability.
