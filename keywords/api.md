## API
The Application Programming Interface (API) is responsible for transmitting data from one device to another by taking in a request and responding with the data requested.

A main advantage of using an API to communicate between the client and the server rather than sending a direct query to the databases is that it protects the database from potential security risks. It also allows developers to keep a similar syntax when requesting data from any type of database. [^dreanfactory2023understanding]
The purpose of an API is to provide the client, whether a mobile application, website or other software, the information to build their product.

There are APIs for different purposes. For example, if making an application that gives information on the weather, an API for the weather would be used to gather the necessary information. The developer or client would send a request to the API server that would return a response including some data. Using APIs also helps construct flexible applications by allowing developers to add functionalities easily to an existing project.[^aws24what] 

Anyone can easily integrate APIs into their projects by searching for them online. However, they are mostly implemented by programmers since it is not meant to be used by the end-user.[^wiki24api]
