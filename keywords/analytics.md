## Analytics

"Analytics" can be defined as the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics aimed at discovering and interpreting patterns, understanding relationships, predicting outcomes, and making informed decisions. It involves the use of various techniques and tools, including data, text, and web mining, to process and analyze large volumes of information from different sources. This process enables organizations to achieve a comprehensive ("360 degrees") view of their operations, customer behaviors, and market trends[^bose09analytics].

Analytics is foundational to business intelligence (BI) and is crucial for enhancing decision-making processes, optimizing operations, and gaining competitive advantages[^watson13analytics]. Successful analytics implementation requires a clear business need, strong leadership and sponsorship, a culture of fact-based decision making, robust data infrastructure, effective analytic tools, and skilled analytical personnel within a supportive organizational structure.

Furthermore, analytics serves as a stepping stone towards the adoption and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) within organizations[^davenport18analytics]. By building upon existing analytical competencies, companies can transition more seamlessly into AI, leveraging statistical methods and other analytical foundations to develop AI systems. The evolution from analytics to AI represents a progression in the sophistication and capability of data analysis technologies, offering new opportunities for innovation and efficiency in business operations.
