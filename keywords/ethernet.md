## Ethernet 

Ethernet is a wired network technology that connects computers to other devices using cables and protocols. It was invented in the early 1970s by Xerox and became a standard in 1983.
It has different types and speeds depending on the cable and device used. The most common types are twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic cables. The most common speeds are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps. [^BasuMallick23ethernet]

Ethernet usually offers faster internet connection than Wi-Fi because of its use of cables rather than radio waves which can be less stable and secure.[^BusinessInsider24ethernet]
