## Network Security

The first thing to know is that Network Security is an extremely complex term. The first thing to understand Network Security is that it is a sub-term under a huge umbrella being computer secuity. An overall explanation of Network Security would be that it's purpose is to provide privacy and confidentiality on the internet. This goal is achieved with how the security functions. Simply put, the main things that Network Security watches are network monitoring, detects intrusion and completes analyses on digital traffic. [^Marin05networksecurity]

It's important to realize that Network Security was created due to the rapid evolution of technology and how easily information is accessible today. With that being said, this creation of internet being in all of our lives and at the tip of our fingers raises risks of invasion of privacy of anyone using it. Now, this is where Network Security comes handy because it's ultimate goal is protect the rights and interests of citizens using technology.[^Sun20networksecurity]

After all that, a really easy way to understand Network Security is fueled by some main goals. These can be, protection against cyberattacks, security breaches and provide users with a secure way of getting any type of resources at anytime. Now this is achieved in multiple ways thanks to Network Security. Protection is achieved through firewalls, network access control, intrustion detection and prevention systems, virtual private networkds, application security and email security.[^WhatIs(n.d)networksecurity] (To understand each and their function/purpose I recommend visiting the cited website)
