## E-commerce
E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to buying and selling goods and services on the internet. It is part of a bigger industry called e-business which includes all the processes that are needed to run an online company.[^Bloomental23ecommerce] Consumers can buy almost everything at any time of the day through ecommerce.[^Forbes23ecommerce]

The history of e-commerce dates back to even before the creation of the Internet. It started with the electronic system called EDI in the 1960s, which allowed document transfers. The first online transaction happened in 1994 when a CD was sold through an online market called NetMarket. Since then, the industry has grown and given rise to today’s popular platforms such as Amazon, eBay, Shopify, etc.[^Bloomental23ecommerce]
