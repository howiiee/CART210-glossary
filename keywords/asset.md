## Asset

The definition of asset in a general context is rooted in the business and economics. In a paper on the definition of a brand asset, the term is defined as a symbol that helps identify goods or services that differentiates it from its competitors.[^tollington98asset]

An asset defined more in lined with traditional media assets, whether that be an audio asset or some form of visual imagery, relates more to the term new media. 

Beyond this general definition, an asset can be defined as the relationship between the computer and the asset.[^mateas05asset] Instead of merely being a playback of sorts, it is defined by the “ratio of computation to the size of the media.” Chris Crawford coins the term “crunch per bit” as the process intensity of the computation. 

Outside of a definition of bits, an asset can also be described as an “intangible asset” as it relates to new media arts.[^tsortanidou19asset] It can play a role in defining an aesthetic or the artistic process.
