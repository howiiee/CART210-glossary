## GAN

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) enable the learning of deep representations without the need 
for significant training data annotation[^wang10GAN]. They do this by generating backpropagation signals via a 
rival approach involving two networks meshing together[^Creswell10GAN]. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 
are a form of artificial intelligence that can create new instances based on patterns discovered in data. They 
excel in creating realistic, high-quality photographs[^goodfellow10GAN]. Essentially, GANs recognize the likelihood of various 
attributes happening in a dataset and utilize that information to generate new, comparable instances[^goodfellow10GAN]. This makes 
them more successful than other approaches that produce pictures using deep learning, a form of sophisticated machine 
learning methodology[^goodfellow10GAN].
