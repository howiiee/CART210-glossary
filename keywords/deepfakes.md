“ for as long as we have been recording the sights and sounds around us, we have been manipulating them”(farid hany)
We are bombarded with manipulated imagery from the humorous to the absurdly unrealistic body images in fashion magazines and Instagram, weaponized in the form of non-consensual pornography, political attack ads, scientific fraud, misrepresentations in the media, and disinformation campaigns design to sow civil unrest and disrupt democratic elections
he most recent development in digital tampering , in the form of automated AI-powered media synthesis and manipulation aka deep fakes
leveraging modern tools in machine learning, computer graphics and computer vision has lowered the skill and time barriers for manipulating content.
While the ability to alter and change and delete content media is not new, the true power of deep fakes is the widespread access to sophisticated technology that previously was only in the hands of Hollywood-style studios and state-sponsored actors, along with the instantaneous and global distribution channels afforded by social media.
