## Mobile Computing

A quick defintion of mobile computing is basically a service that allows users to send anything electronic related with other users. It is important to know that mobile computing allows fast in real time exchanges between people across the world. The key element to know is that it allows users to interact with each other without wires. Also, this concept allows users to access any network at any time or location. With this brief explanation it's easy to link where mobile computing comes into our daily lives. For example, mobile phones are a perfect demonstration of what mobile computing is because phones permit people to chat or access the net anywhere at anytime.[^Sharma22mobilecomputing]

It's important to realize with Mobile Computing that it isn't only linked to portable devices like phones. The concept expands much further, mobile computing also focuses on creating or merging communication and the Internet. Meaning, the ultimate goal of mobile computing is to create portable and powerful tools/mediums combining ways of communication and technology that can ease our daily tasks.[^Currie(n.d)mobilecomputing].

The easiest way to understand this term is to take it literally. The first part being mobile which means something that can be in motion and not constrained by location or time. The second part being computing meaning a form of technology or something that processes and inputs and outputs something.[^Lutkevich(n.d)mobilecomputing]
