## Technological determinism

Technological determinism (TD) is an ideology that asserts that technology fundamentally shapes and influences the development and progress of society. [^adler06technological_determinism] Simply: technology controls the progress of society. Technology is portrayed as an autonomous force with the power to be drivers of social and cultural change, with the belief that technological innovations independently and inevitably shape human society.

The key features of technological determinism include[^chandler95technological_determinism]:

1. Inevitability: TD argues that the impacts of certain technological developments on society and environment are inevitable.

2. Autonomy: TD often implies a level of autonomy for technology, suggesting it progresses and drives societal changes, regardless of human influence.

3. Impact on Social Structure: TD contends that technology not only influences social change but can permeate through social structures, institutions, and behaviors.

4. Unidirectional Influence: TD considers the influence of technology typically unidirectional, with technology being the driving force and society adapting around the changes it brings.

Critics of technological determinism argue that it oversimplifies the complex relationship between technology and society.[^dafoe15technological_determinism] They contend that other factors, such as political, economic, and cultural, play significant roles in shaping the impact of technology on society. Technological determinism faces challenges, especially when historical evidence reveals periods of technological regression in which societies experience setbacks in technological development.
