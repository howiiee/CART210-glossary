## Posthuman

The posthuman is a broad concept defined by two differing - and at times contradicting - schools of thought: the posthuman as "a category that attempts to capture some future configuration"[^rugo20posthuman] and the posthuman as "a condition."[^rugo20posthuman]

On one hand, the posthuman is a subject of human enhancement characterized by at least one capacity that transcends human limitations, unaided by modern technology[^bostrom06posthuman]. This view implies the use of advanced technology, genetic manipulation, and biointervention [^cohen21posthuman] to bring to life such 'advancements' to the human being. On the other hand, the posthuman is also conceived as a critique of humanism, the centralization of the human amongst non-humans, and the idea of man as a measure of all things. Unlike the former school of thought, which seeks to further human superiority - "an extension of rational mastery"[^rugo20posthuman], this philosophical framework "promotes horizontal ontologies and expanded ethics."[^rugo20posthuman]
