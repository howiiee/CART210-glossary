## Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is a recognition system that utilizes biometrics to detect, analyze, and recognize faces.[^kaur20facial] The process can be broken down into three technologies: detection, analysis, and recognition. Detection infers the training of an algorithm to recognize faces; The detected faces are then mapped and converted into a “faceprint”[^klosowski20facial]. Finally, and most notably, faceprints are compared to individuals in a database to find their closest match.[^klosowski20facial]

This software can be traced back to the 1960s. A system developed by Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe in which an "unknown face is compared against data points of previously entered pictures".[^klosowski20facial]
