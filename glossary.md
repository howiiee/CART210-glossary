## Affordance

Gibson coined the term “affordance” to describe what the environment “offers the individual, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” 

Affordances can be viewed as animal-relative properties of the environment. They correspond to the action possibilities offered to an animal by the environment with reference to the individual’s action capabilities. For example, a leaf provides support for a wasp but not for a dog. Here, the support-ability of the leaf is an affordance for the wasp. 

Affordances can vary not only between species but also between the individuals of the same species. A 30-cm stair is climb-able for an adult but not for a child. In sum, affordances are neither objective nor subjective, but both. They are objective because they exist independently of the act of perception. But, they are also subjective because the frame of reference is the individual’s action capabilities. 

Gibson also assumed that affordance perception does not need information processing or internal representations. Rather, affordance perception is direct, corresponding to a learning process based on the extraction of invariants. An animal perceives walk-ability if it sees a flat, extended, rigid, horizontal surface, because this combination of invariants affords support.

Physical versus learned affordance

Norman was inspired by the dichotomy between the ventral system and the dorsal system and drew a close parallel between the functions of the dorsal system and affordances. Specifically, he stressed that some statements made by Gibson were somewhat equivocal. For example, Gibson wrote that the ‘values’ and ‘meanings’ of things in the environment can be directly perceived” or “postboxes afford letter mailing”. Norman proposed that only “physical affordances” are perceived by the dorsal system. So, in the aforementioned example of the postboxes, it would be better to say that slot in the mailbox affords inserting an object of appropriate size and shape.

By contrast, the ventral system is in charge to assign meanings to things, and particularly to provide information about the conventional uses of familiar tools (i.e., familiar tool use). In this case, Norman suggested the notion of “learned affordance”. The physical versus learned affordance dichotomy mirrors the novel versus familiar tool use opposition, respectively. In this view, both types of affordances can contribute to tool use, even though the ability to perform familiar tool use might be one of the properties of the ventral system. 
Importantly, this dichotomy also implies that the perception of physical affordances (dorsal system) guides not only body actions within a hand-centered frame of reference (e.g., reaching, grasping) but also novel tool use, namely, actions involving a toolcentered frame of reference. We see a contradiction in Norman’s argument as he also suggested that the transformation of visual information into a tool-centered framework (called allocentric by Norman) is the specific function of the ventral system (i.e., learned affordance).

By contrast, the dorsal system is responsible for the transformation of “visual information into an egocentric framework allowing the actor to grasp or otherwise bodily manipulate the object” 
Norman and Young (2006) have suggested that the perception of affordances – and more specifically of physical affordances for Norman – might be supported by the dorsal system. The same theoretical rapprochement may be envisaged between the dorsal system and the affordance route to action. Nevertheless, Yoon and Humphreys (2007) argued that such a rapprochement remains to be demonstrated, notably because of studies indicating that action decision tasks can activate the left inferior temporal lobe (i.e., the ventral system).[^neuro&behavior01affordance]

## Agency 

Agency is the “capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power” or the “person or thing through which an end is achieved” using power. [^MerriamWeb24agency] One’s sense of self-agency - that is the sense that there is an “I” who is generating an action - largely depends on “the degree of discrepancy resulting from comparison between the predicted and actual sensory feedback”. [^Sato05agency]

Agency is felt by degrees: one can feel more or less in control. This variation is particularly clear when using machines: the feeling of control varies between different operator inputs and expected machine response. Often, one may knowingly act with agency and receive the expected result of an act. However, these judgements of agency frequently do not follow actual control in situations where agency might be ambiguous.  [^Sato05agency]

## API
The Application Programming Interface (API) is responsible for transmitting data from one device to another by taking in a request and responding with the data requested.

A main advantage of using an API to communicate between the client and the server rather than sending a direct query to the databases is that it protects the database from potential security risks. It also allows developers to keep a similar syntax when requesting data from any type of database. [^dreanfactory2023understanding]
The purpose of an API is to provide the client, whether a mobile application, website or other software, the information to build their product.

There are APIs for different purposes. For example, if making an application that gives information on the weather, an API for the weather would be used to gather the necessary information. The developer or client would send a request to the API server that would return a response including some data. Using APIs also helps construct flexible applications by allowing developers to add functionalities easily to an existing project.[^aws24what] 

Anyone can easily integrate APIs into their projects by searching for them online. However, they are mostly implemented by programmers since it is not meant to be used by the end-user.[^wiki24api]

## Asset

The definition of asset in a general context is rooted in the business and economics. In a paper on the definition of a brand asset, the term is defined as a symbol that helps identify goods or services that differentiates it from its competitors.[^tollington98asset]

An asset defined more in lined with traditional media assets, whether that be an audio asset or some form of visual imagery, relates more to the term new media. 

Beyond this general definition, an asset can be defined as the relationship between the computer and the asset.[^mateas05asset] Instead of merely being a playback of sorts, it is defined by the “ratio of computation to the size of the media.” Chris Crawford coins the term “crunch per bit” as the process intensity of the computation. 

Outside of a definition of bits, an asset can also be described as an “intangible asset” as it relates to new media arts.[^tsortanidou19asset] It can play a role in defining an aesthetic or the artistic process.

## Avatar

An avatar is a digital entity or body through which a human being can experience the events within a digital world, giving the user a “subject-position within a simulated environment, a vicarious body through which the player can act as an agent in a fictional world.”[^Castronova03avatar] 

The term takes its meaning from Hinduism, deriving from a Sanskrit word for “descent” and used to refer to the incarnations the Hindu god Vishnu on earth.[^Klevjer06avatar] This term has evolved to symbolize the body that we inhabit when visiting a virtual world, and that only exists there.[^Trepte/Reinecke10avatar]

The creation and use of avatars began mostly in entertainment media such as video games or virtual reality where they can be used by players to accomplish several gameplay related actions such as combat or communication.  But with the increasing popularity and accessibility of 3D art and 3D creation software, avatars have also found use in the creation of 3D artwork, from artistic screenshots to sceneries. The design of an avatar can be as grounded or fantastical as the user desires, ranging from human-like characters to fantastic beasts. Alongside this, the ever-increasing computing power and graphical capabilities of modern computers expand the options available in avatar creation, enabling users to create avatars with more and more sophisticated designs and details.

## Big Data
Big Data is the use of a large quantity of stored and analyzed information to form accurate understandings and predictions about the world. The wielding of this type of information processing has been accelerated by improvements in technology and the growing amounts of digital connections between people and organizations. [^AsktCite]

Big Data is used in everything from health care to political campaigns. Notably big data was a cornerstone of [Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns](http://www.jstor.org/stable/26466778) where personalized messaging and interaction were optimized by the assessment of potential voter preferences. [^LadonMurraycite] Large-scale data analysis was also used in the NBA to track player shooting accuracy. A sensor placed on the hoop would track and record the player’s shots from different points on the court. It would then be able to suggest where to shoot from to maximize winning potential. [^Ricecite] 
In both of these examples, real-world phenomena were tracked and enumerated. They were then sent through systems and by people who would find patterns that could predict outcomes.

## Blockchain

A blockchain is a shared and public ledger that stores data and is used to record transactions accross multiple computers. This database has a continuously growing list of information/records called blocks which are linked through cryptography. Every block stores a hash, history of the previous block, transactional data, date and time.[^berg18blockchain]

Blockchains are secure and maintain a decentralized record of transactions which is the reason they are used for (although not limited to) cryptocurrencies. There is no way to change a block therefore making it very safe and removes the need of third parties for transfers.[^kulhari18blockchain]

For example, blockchains are used in the monetary world for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum since it ensures transparency between transactions and protects the financial identity of individuals when they use crypto to buy or sell anything.[^segura23blockchain]

## Blog

Blogs are similar to personal journals that are shared on the internet through a website of choice. They are updated often and are aimed for public consumption. 
Blogs tend to follow a specific format where posts are arranged in reverse chronological order. They also allow for easy interaction with others online, people 
can share their ideas and comments instantly for others to engage back.[^andrews07blog]

Blogs represent many things for many different users. It can a way to present introspective thinking, a record of daily events, a tool for political mobilization, 
a journalistic project, an open-ended literary experiment, a constant exhibition of images and/or videos, or often enough, is a different combination of things listed 
above. An early study of blogs summarize them as providing a large variety of expression within the restrictions of the simplicity of the format.[^siles11blog]

Blogs usually tend to have a header, sidebar and footer as well as the main content area. A header can include navigation or menu items, and the sidebar could include 
favourites, masterlists and more. A footer can also be included depending on what kind of blog, and it tends to show contact information.[^greatcontent22blog] However, this does not mean blogs 
are limited to follow this format, it is just commonly follows it. Blogs allow for a lot of customization, this included the format, as well as the aesthetics. 

Blogs are convenient because they allow anyone to curate a space for pretty much anything. It makes it easy for people to share their own content and thoughts, you can easily 
start posting your own writing or art no matter how niche it is.

## CMYK

CMYK is a color model used in printing. It is an abbreviation of **C**yan, **M**agenta, **Y**ellow, and **K**ey (black, which refers to printing plates being keyed or aligned to the black printing plates) which provides a more reliable reproduction of images that RGB cannot provide. It is also used quite a bit thanks to its incredible accuracy that it can hold. While it is not the most accurate with darker tones (leading it to become lighter in rare cases) it still holds up to be the most accurate.

While it has many uses, the most used ways are in medicine and printing processes. 

For medical use, it is used as an analysis tool as you can adapt the CMYK models for use to find certain stains in the cells. For example, in a study conducted to attempt to be able to find IHC (immunohistochemistry) stains, researchers edited the CMYK model to be able to read better the IHC as well as being able to tell STAT3 levels easier thanks to the better Yellow channel.

For printing, as it’s most common usage. It is used side by side with Pantone as they are the two printing styles that offer the most accurate version of the original image/as the creator intends. As screens normally use RGB, most software defaults with RGB which makes it so that printers normally turn the image into CMYK for easier printing.

## Codec

A "codec," which stands for "coder-decoder" or "compressor-decompressor," is a type of technology primarily used in digital media for encoding and decoding audio and video streams. The primary purpose of a codec is to compress large multimedia files to reduce their size for more efficient storage and faster transmission over networks, which is particularly vital in applications like webcasting, video conferencing, and online streaming.

Codecs work by compressing (coding) a media file when it is saved or transmitted and then decompressing (decoding) it for playback or editing. This process involves removing redundant or unnecessary data, and in some cases, data that is less perceivable to human senses, such as inaudible sounds in audio (as seen in MP3 codecs). The level of compression can vary, with some codecs prioritizing higher compression rates to save on bandwidth and storage, while others focus on retaining higher quality with less compression.

Different codecs are optimized for specific types of data. For instance, some are tailored for human speech, making them ideal for voice calls or audio books, while others are designed for high-fidelity music or complex video sequences[^kerdranvat20codec]. The effectiveness of a codec is a balance between the processing power required for compression and decompression, and the level of compression achieved. More efficient codecs that achieve higher compression rates typically require more processing power, which can be a consideration for devices with limited computational resources.

The development and evolution of codecs have played a pivotal role in shaping the handling of multimedia on the Internet[^chen18codec]. For example, the introduction of the MP3 format revolutionized the music industry by allowing for the easy digital distribution of music, albeit raising significant copyright issues. Similarly, advancements in video codecs, such as AV1, HEVC, and AVC, have significantly impacted online video streaming, providing high-quality video at lower bandwidths.

In the realm of visual arts, the artistic exploration of codecs is exemplified by German artist Thomas Ruff's JPEGs series. Starting in 2002, Ruff used digital photographs taken by himself and from the web, compressed using the maximum rate, and then decompressed into large-scale prints. This method of hypercompression and enlargement highlights the mathematical infrastructure of the JPEG image, exposing the pixel blocks into which the image is split during the compression process. Ruff's work turns a digital artifact (pixelation) into a default aesthetic, reflecting how JPEG has become the modern default mode of viewing images online and on-screen. This illustrates a shift from geometric projection to algorithmic processing in image creation, emphasizing that 'photographic' now denotes a specific mode of image processing, with the mathematical matrix used during compression as the new 'architectural order' of the image[^hoelzl13codec].

The ongoing innovation in codec technology, including the development of both proprietary and open-source variants, continues to be integral to enhancing multimedia experiences on the Internet. This is especially evident in the increasing demand for codecs that can provide high video compression efficiency in the face of rising video data traffic, balancing the need for quality, bandwidth availability, and processing capability.

## Copyright

Copyright is a right that allows people to copy or recreate a work, ranging from artistic creations to a computer program. A person who owns the copyright of a certain work owns all the rights to it. It is used to protect it's creators from having their work copied, sold or posted online without their permission. Creators can extend the copyright to another person if they choose to do so.[^govcan23copyright] The laws of copyright vary from country to country, with some laws being stricter than others.

The first copyright law passed in America was in 1790 in the United States, which initially protectected books, maps and charts. In the 1800s, other mediums were added such as published music, dramatic works and works of art. Motion pictures were added as early as 1912 and computer programs joined the list in the late 80s. With the arrival of VHS tapes, the laws were updated to prevent private recordings from being sold.[^davidson00copyright]

Copyright can expire after a certain amount of years. The time it takes for it to expire may vary on the country. It would then fall into the public domain, where it becomes available to be used, distributed or reworked freely.[^dulongmartin12copyright]

## Creative Commons

In an easy way to understand, Creative Commons is basically a fancy law regarding copyright. Essentially, why Creative Commons are so particular is because they are a more globally known copyright law which easier to use and more common. In simple terms, when an author uses Creative Commons on his work he's allowing users/readers to reuse their work on another.[^Harington20creativecommons] Moreover, the praticality of Creative Commons is also really important to know. In fact, when Creative Commons are used appropriately users don't have any financial, legal or politcal constraints. Basically, a worry-free enviornment for using people's content. [^Margoni16creativecommons]

With the concept now explained it's important to also know the format/protocols authors need to follow to apply Creative Commons licenses. To use these licenses there are four conditions that have to be met. These conditions can be mixed into six different licenses. To grasp this idea I recommend watching the following Youtube video. [^CreativeCommons17creativecommons] The last thing to remember from this is that at the end of the day the Creative Commons licenses come in three formats which are machine-readable, lawyer-readable and human-readable.

## Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies used by governments and centralized banks, the main idea is that cryptocurrencies attempt to operate on decentralized networks founded on blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies rely on secure distributed ledger data structures; where mining is an integral part of Proof-of-Work systems. Mining requires the use of computer power to solve complex mathematical problems (encrypted transaction keys), validate transactions, and add them to the blockchain. A successful miner is rewarded with newly created cryptocurrency as an incentive.[^watorek21cryptocurrency] Other systems also exist such as Proof-of-Stake or PoS for short.[^mukhopadhyay16cryptocurrency] PoS relies on participants holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions and create new blocks, eliminating the need for intensive computational work. Cryptocurrency can typically be bought on trading exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase, but can also be bought and sold via peer-to-peer methods.[^wu21cryptocurrency] Digital currencies can also be stored on software-wallets and hardware-wallets. In most cases, the singular term cryptocurrency can mean a token. Some notable cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. Any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin, is considered as an Altcoin. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, new projects, cryptocurrencies, altcoins, systems, and use cases are being implemented.

## Cultural Determinism

Cultural determinism is a theory that bases our emotions and behaviors upon the culture in which we are raised. It suggests that cultural and social influence dominate biological behavior. Breaking the theory down into two concepts, culture is the sum of attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another; while determinism is a philosophical position whereby an event has conditions that could not be caused by any other means.  [^feenberg10CD]

Cultural determinism may not be all determinant, however. Often we are pressured into following cultural norms without understanding or recognizing those norms. As long as the culture’s coercion remains unconscious, there are few opportunities to act outside of those norms. But it’s not entirely unusual for a person to become aware of their cultural coercion, and act in a different way. [^ketner71CD] Would this resistance to cultural expectations also be a culture-bound decision?

## Cyberspace

Cyberspace’s current definition according to the CSRC (Computer Security Resource Center) is “The complex environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form.” [^bussel23wiki]

The term, cyberspace, has always meant a virtual “place” accessed through the internet by machines. When it first appeared in Omni Magazine in 1982, in a short story written by the Canadian-American author William Gibson, it was referred to as a computer network filled with artificial beings. In the same year, the movie Tron was released, depicting a completely digital world. This popularized the idea that computers shared a digital location in which one could interact with digital beings.[^csrc24wiki]

In the 1990s, due to the pop culture popularization of the term, the definition morphed into “The ‘location’ in which people interacted with each other while using the Internet.” It became the “space” where one played online games or interacted on forums and blogs. [^dclark10wiki]

## Deep fakes

•	synthetic media
•	vary in their form and creation ( text, image, audio, video)
•	automatically synthesized by a machine-learning system.
•	Can manipulate reality

“ for as long as we have been recording the sights and sounds around us, we have been manipulating them”(farid hany)
We are bombarded with manipulated imagery from the humorous to the absurdly unrealistic body images in fashion magazines and Instagram, weaponized in the form of non-consensual pornography, political attack ads, scientific fraud, misrepresentations in the media, and disinformation campaigns design to sow civil unrest and disrupt democratic elections
he most recent development in digital tampering , in the form of automated AI-powered media synthesis and manipulation aka deep fakes
leveraging modern tools in machine learning, computer graphics and computer vision has lowered the skill and time barriers for manipulating content.
While the ability to alter and change and delete content media is not new, the true power of deep fakes is the widespread access to sophisticated technology that previously was only in the hands of Hollywood-style studios and state-sponsored actors, along with the instantaneous and global distribution channels afforded by social media.

# Digitization:

Digitization is a process or a creation of a physical object that becomes photographed, processed into the computer using descriptive coding and then fully becomes a digital media that can be viewed across any search engine.[^mallison23digitization] Digitization entails any physical object or in-person sound that was scanned or recorded and uploaded to a computer to then be showcased within the digital realm. By digitizing data and services, it allows things like energy transformation, mobility and logistic sectors, and enhanced health care to be possible.[^kagermann15digitization] 

An example of digitization is taking a photo with a camera of something and then uploading it onto the computer to edit it, just by uploading it or scanning it, within the computer the image is being hardcoded to now be a digital image able to be manipulated unlike the actual object itself. Another example can be written text as well as typewritten text when written on the computer turns the process digital. The process of converting music from a VHS tape and making it into an LP or video is also a form of digitization. Digitization ultimately becomes the idea that all the analog elements as well as physical elements that are then hardcoded into a computer using ones and zeros are now a digitized version of them.[^bloomberg18digitization]

## DNS
The Domain Name System is a system that matches the name in the URL to the IP address of the sites we are looking for on the Internet. This makes it easier for us to naviagte to our favorite websites rather than remembering their IP addresses.[^couldflare24what] The DNS provides the corresponding IP address to the domain name for browsers to find the page we are searching for.

## E-commerce
E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to buying and selling goods and services on the internet. It is part of a bigger industry called e-business which includes all the processes that are needed to run an online company.[^Bloomental23ecommerce] Consumers can buy almost everything at any time of the day through ecommerce.[^Forbes23ecommerce]

The history of e-commerce dates back to even before the creation of the Internet. It started with the electronic system called EDI in the 1960s, which allowed document transfers. The first online transaction happened in 1994 when a CD was sold through an online market called NetMarket. Since then, the industry has grown and given rise to today’s popular platforms such as Amazon, eBay, Shopify, etc.[^Bloomental23ecommerce]

## Embodiment 
![Embodiment](images/embodiment-rezaee.png)
As an overall term, embodiment can carry several meanings. Embody in dictionary... Latin root of embody... Its most common use deals with physical representations of subjects both real and abstract. For example, "She is the embodiment of anger!", this concrete defintion is simple enough to understand. However depending on context the definition of the term shifts. 

In computation and media, embodiment is a discourse that can be deeply philosophical and has a rich history. Within the body's interactions itself, there are many forms of abstraction to be dealt with. Many people have heard of the comparison of brains to computer. The early 4EA (Embodied, Embedded, Extended, Enacted, Affective) cognitive science movement questioned the notion of computation related to an organism. These thinkers arrived to the conclusion that... Today, there remains three schools of thought to consider: body conservationism, body functionalism and body enactivism. The latter of which states that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction between an organism, its body, and its environment [^kiverstein05wiki].

The social aspect of media deepens this discourse, our presence online... Our online embodiments, uch as avatars are an emphatical form of embodiment. and personas [^kleyjer01wiki].  

Other things to consider are human interaction with the computer [^chen02wiki], 

immersion [^dyson03wiki], 

cyborgs [^haddow04wiki] and more.

## Ethernet 

Ethernet is a wired network technology that connects computers to other devices using cables and protocols. It was invented in the early 1970s by Xerox and became a standard in 1983.
It has different types and speeds depending on the cable and device used. The most common types are twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic cables. The most common speeds are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps. [^BasuMallick23ethernet]

Ethernet usually offers faster internet connection than Wi-Fi because of its use of cables rather than radio waves which can be less stable and secure.[^BusinessInsider24ethernet]

## Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is a recognition system that utilizes biometrics to detect, analyze, and recognize faces.[^kaur20facial] The process can be broken down into three technologies: detection, analysis, and recognition. Detection infers the training of an algorithm to recognize faces; The detected faces are then mapped and converted into a “faceprint”[^klosowski20facial]. Finally, and most notably, faceprints are compared to individuals in a database to find their closest match.[^klosowski20facial]

This software can be traced back to the 1960s. A system developed by Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe in which an "unknown face is compared against data points of previously entered pictures".[^klosowski20facial]

## Firewall

![Firewall](images/firewall-tran.jpg)

A firewall is like a security gate that controls what comes in and out. It is a network security device that monitors the incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block them based on a set of defined security rules. 
There are different types of firewalls, such as proxy, stateful inspection, UTM, next-generation, cloud-native firewalls and more, each with different features and functions. [^Cisco24firewall]

A firewall has many benefits, such as blocking spyware, stopping virus attacks, promoting privacy, and network traffic, and preventing hackers from accessing the network. [^Spiceworks24firewall]

## GAN

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) enable the learning of deep representations without the need 
for significant training data annotation[^wang10GAN]. They do this by generating backpropagation signals via a 
rival approach involving two networks meshing together[^Creswell10GAN]. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 
are a form of artificial intelligence that can create new instances based on patterns discovered in data. They 
excel in creating realistic, high-quality photographs[^goodfellow10GAN]. Essentially, GANs recognize the likelihood of various 
attributes happening in a dataset and utilize that information to generate new, comparable instances[^goodfellow10GAN]. This makes 
them more successful than other approaches that produce pictures using deep learning, a form of sophisticated machine 
learning methodology[^goodfellow10GAN].

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git,[^github24wikis] allowing users to manage and share code in various repositories and offering wikis for documentation and collaborative editing. GitHub employs Git software, offering distributed version control, access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and project [wikis](../main/glossary.md#wiki).[^kinsta24what]

As of 2020, GitHub is the most important platform for collaborative Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development, with 31 million user accounts and over 100 million code repositories.[^zoller20topology] FLOSS development is associated with the idea of commons-based peer production, presenting it as a different approach to creating goods and services compared to traditional market or hierarchical methods. It is seen as a method for producing without the usual power imbalances.

GitHub's development process is distributed, allowing developers to collaborate, discuss, and comment on code from various locations. This platform generates a wealth of textual, numerical, and collaborative data, making it a prime source for software engineering research.[^seker20open]

## GUI (Graphical User Interface)


## Haptics

The word “haptics” means ‘concerned with the sense of touch’ [^haptics1]. It is believed to have come from the Greek word “hapthesthai” [^haptics1]. In psychology and medicine, haptics refers to the study of how humans process sensory touch input through the body’s touch receptors [^haptics1]. In the late twentieth century, the definition had to be broadened because emergent technologies such as robots, video game consoles and virtual reality are all capable of creating touch sensations [^haptics2]. Thus, in the context of new media, haptics is defined as physical sensations—such as pushes or vibrations—that a user experiences while using an electronic device [^haptics3].

## Hash Functions

A hash function, used within code, is meant to turn numerical or string instances, or "keys", into usable buckets of data, known as "hashes". When you hash a message, it takes your file or message of any size, runs it through a mathematical algorithm, and spits out an output of a fixed length. 
Usually implemented to fulfill a form of a hash table, it operates three various functions within itself:
- It converts the keys into fixed lengths using ADD or XOR
- It rearranges the bits to uniformly disturbute them over the keyspace
- Generate a hash that is equal to or less than the network's target hash [^Frankenfield23whatishash]



In laymans terms, it stores each value into a book of sorts, storing it then in a bookshelf for easy keeping, by assigning the often times complex wording scheme into a simple letter, less than or equal to the amount of space the bookshelf has.

Used in other languages such  as C#, PHP, Java, and Python, it is often times implemented by default for a variety of those listed above, and can be overridden to suit the users needs for that specific program or project.

As well, it is used in certain types of modern cryptography, mostly within banks for making sure no fraudulance can happen within. Based on the Security by Obscurity Approach, the whole cryptosystem is communicating securely while maintaining a high level of privacy. [^Ahmed22hashfunctionapplications] Even though hash functions have many applications in modern cryptography, they
are perhaps best known for the important role they play in the practical use of digital signatures. [^Paar70hashfunction]

## Hashtag

![Hashtag](images/hashtag-tham.png)

A hashtag, denoted by the symbol “#”, is a metadata tag commonly use in the Internet culture, particularly on social media.[^Merriam-Webester24Hashtag]  It originated as a feature on a post on Twitterin August 2007 from a product designer named Chris Messina. The primary purpose was to provide user with an easy way to categorize, discover and participate in specific topics on social media.[^Hastags.org12Whatis#] In addition, Tweets containing hashtags can link to a specific timeline of other tweets with the same hashtag.[^WikströmHashtagOnTwitter]

Hashtags have significantly impacted the overall performance of social media content which can help small businesses, influencers, brands and many more to reach a bigger audience. A hashtag can contain multiple word without space, such as `#dogLover` and may also contain numbers. They can be added to social media posts, bios, comments, and other content. They are utilized across various platform, including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and many more.[^SproutSocial23HashtagsWhatAreThey] 

In addition, hashtags can be useful in assisting people in need. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Instagram hashtags helped young people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by fostering scientific education and promoting remote learning.[^PublicHealth22Instagram]

## HTTPS

HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP but is more secure as it incorporates encryption, authentication, and integrity checks. It provides a secure method for transmitting data between a web server and a web browser by using encryption technology like SSL or TLS. It operates on a request-response model, it sends a request and awaits the server’s response.[^WhatIsHTTPS24]
HTTPS safeguards users against any malicious activities such as eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle attacks. It is relatively easy to impersonate, modify or monitor an HTTP connection since any information is sent as a plain text. Therefore, using HTTPS is more secure and ensure that no attacks can temper with the exchanged information.[^HypertextTransferProtocolSecure22]

### HTTPS Cryptographic protocols

#### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
SSL is the predecessor to the modern encryption, TLS. It was developed by Netscape in 1995[^CloudflareWhatIsSSL24] for ensuring the identity and authentication of a website, enabling a secure HTTP session between the client and the server. However, since SSL 3.0,  developed in 1996, several vulnerabilities have been identified, rendering it unsafe for use. Consequently, most browsers no longer support this protocol.

#### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
TLS is the successor of SSL and ensures privacy, authenticity and data security while exchanging data over the internet. The key difference between SSL and TLS lies in the handshake process, where a browser authenticates a server’s SSL or TLS certificate. SSL handshake involves an explicit connection and has more steps, while TLS is an implicit one, making it faster.[^AWSDifferenceBetweenSSL]

The term SSL and SSL/TLS both refer to the TLS protocol and certificates, as all version of SSL are now deprecated.

HTTPS contributes to a better overall user experience by providing faster loading times, especially on modern web browsers and prioritize secure connections. Additionally, search engines prioritize websites that use HTTPS in their search results.[^LinkedInHTTPSSEO24] It plays an important role in facilitating secure communication and interaction across various platform, including social media, streaming service and many more website. It does integrate an safety wall for the users navigating the web.

## Hypertext

Ted Nelson first introduces the term in his 1965 paper “A File Structure for the Complex, the changing and the indeterminate”, describing it as “a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper”.[^TedNelson1965]

Hypertext is a digital form of writing text, exploiting the use of hyperlinks. Commonly found in webpages, documents or files, hyperlinks are clickable & link to other webpages/texts/media on the internet (commonly known as “links”). [The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/) defines hypertext as “text stored in a computer system that contains links that allow the user to move from one piece of text or document to another”.[^OxfordHypertext]

Hypertext allows people to easily access information from multiple sources and navigate through and between multiple documents from different sources on the web. As a form of information management, hypertext allows for a non-linear, and less restrictive exploration of digital content & information.[^JSMERP16]

## Information Architecture 


Information architecture is an area within the field of library and information science. [^dillon05information_architecture] It is the practice of making information easily accessible and understandable.[^usibility19information_architecture]
Thus, it involves processes such as searching, categorizing, and presenting relevant information to help individuals understand how to access the things that they are looking to find. [^rosenfeld98information_architecture]

Nowadays, the term has become mostly associated with web design as it is quite useful to create a comprehensible and easily navigated website.[^dillon05information_architecture]
But it is important to remember that the fundamental aspects of information architecture can be easily applied to the physical world and not only to the World Wide Web.[^dillon05information_architecture]
For instance, it is put into use in most public spaces such as department stores and museums. We know exactly that we will be able to find our favorite ice cream flavor in the frozen food aisle just as we know that we will find the Egyptian sarcophagi in the wing of the museum that is dedicated to Egyptian art and artifacts.

In the context of creating a website, information architecture is about setting up a framework such that the user has a cohesive, coherent, and consistent experience. 
The word “architecture” is a fitting metaphor because to achieve such an endeavor of creating a sustainable experience for the user—to create the larger picture—it is important to understand underlying factors and the ways in which they relate to each other within these complex multidimensional information spaces.[^rosenfeld98information_architecture]

Information architecture is more and more significant because we live in a world where information is never-ending.[^usibility19information_architecture]

## Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that enables individuals around the world to communicate and exchange information. [^Zare24internet1] 

The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven. The word Internet was used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual, and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork. Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.[^Zare24internet2] 
The term internet (or internetwork) is simply a contraction of the phrase inter-network. However, when written with a capital "I," the Internet refers to a global network of interconnected systems. [^Zare24internet3]

The Internet functions as an interactive medium, linking millions of devices and people. It facilitates data transmission, communication across several platforms, and access to a wide range of information. The Internet is naturally interactive, allowing computer users to communicate across networks. [^Zare24internet4] 

The Internet has empowered ordinary citizens by making it easier for them to produce and distribute information to a variety of audiences. This transformation has caused a fundamental shift in the traditional media landscape. [^Zare24internet5]

## Lossless
Lossless is when there is no loss in data. When compressing a file, we want to store fewer bits all while preserving the original content [^crashcourse2017lossless], this is so that data is easier to store or transmit more efficiently[^lu2016lossless]. Lossless compression occurs when the decompressed data is the same as before the compression occurred[^crashcourse2017lossless]. For example, PNG is a lossless compression [^brian2022lossless] because the compression does not affect the quality of the image.

Techniques used are called dictionary code and run length encoding. Run length encoding is where redundant data is represented differently to save space. For example, if an image contains 7 yellow pixels instead of storing each yellow pixel 7 time it would be better to say there 7 yellow pixels and would only need to mention that there a yellow pixel one time.[^crashcourse2017lossless]

In our contemporary world, lossless compression is important because we live in a digital era, where more often than not we are constantly sharing information online to our friends, peers and colleagues. Whether it’s images or text files, lossless compression plays a crucial role since it important to be able to send out information quickly and efficiently without losing any of that data.

##Meme

Wikipedia defines a meme (/miːm/ MEEM) as an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. [^wikipedia24meme]

The term meme was introduced by the biologist Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene. A meme is a unit of culture, such as “tunes, ideas, catch‐phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or building arches”. Dawkins defined memes as small cultural units of transmission, analogous to genes, which are spread from person to person by copying or imitation.  [^Dawkins76meme]

The phrase “Internet meme” is commonly applied to describe the propagation of content items such as jokes, rumors, videos, or websites from one person to others via the Internet. According to this popular notion, an Internet meme may spread in its original form, but it often also spawns user-created derivatives. [^Shifman13meme]

## Mobile Computing

A quick defintion of mobile computing is basically a service that allows users to send anything electronic related with other users. It is important to know that mobile computing allows fast in real time exchanges between people across the world. The key element to know is that it allows users to interact with each other without wires. Also, this concept allows users to access any network at any time or location. With this brief explanation it's easy to link where mobile computing comes into our daily lives. For example, mobile phones are a perfect demonstration of what mobile computing is because phones permit people to chat or access the net anywhere at anytime.[^Sharma22mobilecomputing]

It's important to realize with Mobile Computing that it isn't only linked to portable devices like phones. The concept expands much further, mobile computing also focuses on creating or merging communication and the Internet. Meaning, the ultimate goal of mobile computing is to create portable and powerful tools/mediums combining ways of communication and technology that can ease our daily tasks.[^Currie(n.d)mobilecomputing].

The easiest way to understand this term is to take it literally. The first part being mobile which means something that can be in motion and not constrained by location or time. The second part being computing meaning a form of technology or something that processes and inputs and outputs something.[^Lutkevich(n.d)mobilecomputing]

## Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a broad field driven by both computerized and theoretical approaches to analyze and represent human languages.[^Chowdhary01NPL]

As this topic related to Natural Language Processing (NPL) remains a very active area for research and development, many might acknowledge that a one-size-fits-all approach for definiting this field might not fit all. Altought, a commont central purpose and understanding knowledge remains including the goal of achieving human-like language processing for a various of tasks and application.[^Liddy02NPL]

## Network Security

The first thing to know is that Network Security is an extremely complex term. The first thing to understand Network Security is that it is a sub-term under a huge umbrella being computer secuity. An overall explanation of Network Security would be that it's purpose is to provide privacy and confidentiality on the internet. This goal is achieved with how the security functions. Simply put, the main things that Network Security watches are network monitoring, detects intrusion and completes analyses on digital traffic. [^Marin05networksecurity]

It's important to realize that Network Security was created due to the rapid evolution of technology and how easily information is accessible today. With that being said, this creation of internet being in all of our lives and at the tip of our fingers raises risks of invasion of privacy of anyone using it. Now, this is where Network Security comes handy because it's ultimate goal is protect the rights and interests of citizens using technology.[^Sun20networksecurity]

After all that, a really easy way to understand Network Security is fueled by some main goals. These can be, protection against cyberattacks, security breaches and provide users with a secure way of getting any type of resources at anytime. Now this is achieved in multiple ways thanks to Network Security. Protection is achieved through firewalls, network access control, intrustion detection and prevention systems, virtual private networkds, application security and email security.[^WhatIs(n.d)networksecurity] (To understand each and their function/purpose I recommend visiting the cited website)

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational frameworks that mimic the brain's structure consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). These networks, through training, learn to perform tasks by adjusting connections based on input data, improving accuracy over time without explicit task-specific programming. They are fundamental in fields like image recognition, natural language processing, and more, due to their ability to learn from vast amounts of data and identify patterns that are not easily discernible by humans. [^NeuralNetworksHerve] . Neural networks are advanced tools for solving specific problems in areas like pattern recognition and data analysis due to their high speed and learning capabilities from examples (training data sets). [^NeuralNetworksBishop] . 

Overall, Neural network research explores how computers can mimic the brain's way of processing information, moving away from traditional step-by-step computing to more interconnected and simultaneous methods. Researchers are trying to simplify and understand how these brain-like systems can solve complex tasks by focusing on neurons, which are like tiny processing units influenced by their connections' strengths. They also look into how these networks learn and improve through a process called backpropagation. [^BasicIdeasInNeuralNetworks] .

## NFT 

A Non-Fungible Token, or NFT, is a unique digital identifier that gets stored on a Blockchain[^opensea22nft]. Essentially, it’s a completely unique link representing a digital item that gets added to an ever-growing and immutable list, serving as a publicly accessible record.

## Open Source

Open source refers to software with source code made accessible to the public to view, modify, and distribute. It centers around community collaboration, the importance of peer review, and process transparency. [^osi01Wiki] Open source software is typically available for no charge and prevents entities from having total market control over source code. [^diffingo02Wiki]

Software sharing was integral throughout software’s early history, but as software became less tied to specific hardware and more monetizable, proprietary software became more appealing to companies. The free software movement arose in response to this through important figures such as Richard Stallman. With ambiguity surrounding the word “free”, the idea of open source was proposed. [^producingOSS03wiki] The history of the free software movement and the open-source-software movement are closely interlinked but remain separate movements. 

Some popular examples of open source software include the Linux operating system, the Mozilla Firefox browser, and LibreOffice.

## Pantone
Pantone is a color system used in printing that allows for a universal agreement on specific colors we expect to get from print.

There are two color systems that designers can work with depending on their needs, the Pantone Matching System and the Pantone Fashion, Home + Interior System.  [^pantone24what]

#### Pantone Matching System (PMS):
This system is meant for designers who work on print projects such as editorial, packaging, digital and screenprinting.[^pantone24what]

#### Pantone Fashion, Home + Interior System (FHI):
This system is useful for projects a variety of projects unrelated to prints. It is often used by fashion designers and interior designers when working with apparel, fabrics, soft goods, cosmetics, paints, leather and accessories. [^pantone24what]

The purpose of having two color systems is to better control the appearance of color depending on the material the designer works with. Some colors can not be produced on certain materials. The Pantone system helps designers guarantee that the end product will match the exact Pantone color swatch they chose during production.

### Pantone vs CMYK
Pantone is more costly than printing in CMYK since it requires more labor. The print technician must follow color mix specifications to achieve the exact Pantone swatch requested. This process creates a color that is solid and saturated. On the other hand, CMYK in printing separates the file into cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Dots of each colors are printed on the surface to reach the final product. This can sometimes create variations in color differing from what is seen on the computer screen.[^paperstreet09when]

Using the Pantone system is good for printing projects that do not have many colors. It also allows designers to print colors unachievable with CMYK such as gold, silver and neon colors. However, CMYK can also do a decent print job, especially for projects with color photography. It is up to the designer to decide which system better suits their project.

## Pattern Recognition

Pattern Recogntion is a machine learning process in which the computer is fed a large pool of data that they will attempt to find regularities in order to automatically recognise the content. This recognition can be applied to any form of media whether it be text, images, sounds and much more. It is also expected that the algorithm can "recognize and classify unfamiliar objects, recognize shapes and objects from different angles, and identify patterns and objects even if they’re partially obscured."[^citation1]

Scientific innovations such as prostehtic arms can use this technology to their advantage by applying Electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition which is a recognition system "constructed for real-time control of a prosthetic arm through precise identification of motion and speed command" [^citation3]. This method uses an accumulation of data such as distances recorded with the help aritificial intelligence and multiple reference paremeters.  [^citation2]

Other practical applications of pattern recognition can be found in every day life such as speech and fingerprint recognition used by your smartphone, image recognition that can define contrasts in a photo as well as more professional fields such as the medicine and economy which uses it for medical imaging and data analysis to predict the market fluctuations.

## Posthuman

The posthuman is a broad concept defined by two differing - and at times contradicting - schools of thought: the posthuman as "a category that attempts to capture some future configuration"[^rugo20posthuman] and the posthuman as "a condition."[^rugo20posthuman]

On one hand, the posthuman is a subject of human enhancement characterized by at least one capacity that transcends human limitations, unaided by modern technology[^bostrom06posthuman]. This view implies the use of advanced technology, genetic manipulation, and biointervention [^cohen21posthuman] to bring to life such 'advancements' to the human being. On the other hand, the posthuman is also conceived as a critique of humanism, the centralization of the human amongst non-humans, and the idea of man as a measure of all things. Unlike the former school of thought, which seeks to further human superiority - "an extension of rational mastery"[^rugo20posthuman], this philosophical framework "promotes horizontal ontologies and expanded ethics."[^rugo20posthuman]

## Quantum Computing
Quantum Computing is an emerging type of computing that utilizes principles of quantum mechanics to expedite certain processes and calculations, faster than classical computing. A key principle in the difference between quantum and classical computing is qubits. Like bits, a qubit can be in 2 states, a 0 or a 1. However, operating under quantum mechanics, a qubit can be in a third state called superposition. This essentially means that, before being measured, a qubit exists in the states of 0 and 1 simultaneously[^mcmahon08quantum]. This allows the quantum computers to process multiple calculations concurrently and sort databases with optimized algorithms which accelerates the processing speed. This function is called parallelism[^gruska99quantum]. 
Another quantum mechanic property that qubits posses is entanglement. This is the concept of two or more particles (or qubits) become entwined where the state of one particle determines the state of the other particle (and vice-versa) regardless of distance[^rieffel00introduction]. This principle permits qubits to execute specific quantum algorithms that enhance information processing as well as perform parallelism tasks instantly through intertwined qubits. These operations of the qubits are all manipulated through quantum gates, which are the foundational element of quantum computing[^mcmahon08quantum]. Sequences quantum gates are used to create quantum circuits, which are representations of quantum algorithms. 
While the potential of quantum computers is immense and exciting, the practicality of these computers is lacking. To construct this machine, it requires an immense amount of cooling to maintain the superconducting capabilities of the materials. Specifically, about a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero[^ibm24quantum]. This requires super-cooling fluids which cost a lot of money and make these machines inaccessible to regular people and exclusive to companies who have the space and funds.

## Ransomware

Ransomware is a specific class of malware that demand a payment in exchange for a stolen functionality. The phenomenon first appeared around 2005. Most ransomwares “make an intensive use of file encryption as an extortion means… they encrypt various files on victim’s hard drives before asking for a ransom to get the files decrypted.” [^Gazet10RW]

There are 4 more major types of ransomware: crypto (encrypts data important to victims), locker (locks victims out of their systems), scareware (tricks users into buying or downloading malicious software, often through startling messages), and leakware (threatens to make users data public unless a ransom is paid).

## Social Networking
The act of social networking refers to using any form of internet-based social media websites, such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook to stay connected with family and friends alike, while also sharing any multiple forms of media[^Kenton] (Kenton, 2023). From the examples listed, they each have different uses, for example, Instagram is a video and picture sharing application where others can like and share the things you upload. Twitter is a communication network, where users can share their thoughts by using hashtags. Lastly, Facebook is an application meant for connecting with friends and distant family members to remain in touch with them. The use of social networking can either be social, to communicate and interact with others online, or business, to talk about your field with likeminded individuals. It has changed “our means of gathering information and communicating with each other and contributing to both these practices through creative production”[^Fenton]. While there are some advantages about social networking there are also some disadvantages such as the spreading of misinformation, anonymity, and cause depressive symptoms, anxiety, and low self-esteem[^Pantic].

## Software

Software is a collection of commands or instructions that tell a computer how to behave [^software3]. It is opposite to hardware, which refers to all physical components of a computer [^software1]. Software encompasses not only the code which a computer executes, but also the process of designing and testing the code [^software2].

## Technological determinism

Technological determinism (TD) is an ideology that asserts that technology fundamentally shapes and influences the development and progress of society. [^adler06technological_determinism] Simply: technology controls the progress of society. Technology is portrayed as an autonomous force with the power to be drivers of social and cultural change, with the belief that technological innovations independently and inevitably shape human society.

The key features of technological determinism include[^chandler95technological_determinism]:

1. Inevitability: TD argues that the impacts of certain technological developments on society and environment are inevitable.

2. Autonomy: TD often implies a level of autonomy for technology, suggesting it progresses and drives societal changes, regardless of human influence.

3. Impact on Social Structure: TD contends that technology not only influences social change but can permeate through social structures, institutions, and behaviors.

4. Unidirectional Influence: TD considers the influence of technology typically unidirectional, with technology being the driving force and society adapting around the changes it brings.

Critics of technological determinism argue that it oversimplifies the complex relationship between technology and society.[^dafoe15technological_determinism] They contend that other factors, such as political, economic, and cultural, play significant roles in shaping the impact of technology on society. Technological determinism faces challenges, especially when historical evidence reveals periods of technological regression in which societies experience setbacks in technological development.

## User
A user has many definitions, but let’s focus on the concept of an end user within the technology field. An end user is a person who utilizes a product or service such as a computer, software and many more, without involvement in its production or sell. Therefore, they are often referred to as customer and operator[^TheStateOfTheArtInEndUser]. End users typically have user accounts with usernames and passwords to authenticate themselves within a system.[^Chinel23Whatisuser]

The term "user" originates from the Old French word "user," meaning to employ or make use of, and also from Vulgar Latin "usare," which denotes making use of or taking advantage of something. The term "user" in the context of computers was invented in 1967. [^etymolineUser] One of the earliest instances of its use in the context of computing can be traced back to the pioneering work at institutions like the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society.[^StackExchangeWhyCalledUsers]

Understanding the needs of customers who utilize the product is important for developing the best product tailored for the intended users. In addition, gathering input from users through surveys, interviews, and testing can provide valuable feedback. This feedback can help identify areas for improvement and enable the customization of the user experience to better meet the users’ needs.[^Indeed23WhatIsAnEndUser]

Users interact with technology in various ways, including navigating interfaces, inputting commands, providing data, and receiving outputs. Therefore, user experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) play a crucial role in the success of a product or service. It is important to consider the end-user experience during the developing of the products and services.[^IntuitMailchimp24EndUser]

## Version Control

### Definition

Version Control Systems (VCS) are a type of [software](./software.md) used in programming. Their purpose is to help manage code during the development of a project so as to ensure a proper workflow and effort coordination in the development team.

Namely, it keeps track of every change made in the project and by whom, it allows the possibility to protect certain versions of the code from being edited directly, and lets people work on different "branches" of the same code before merging them together, usually after being reviewed by at least another person. It's also useful when trying to find bugs in the code that appear in later versions by comparing it to older ones.[^Atlassian-VCS]

### Types of VCS

Version control systems are split between two distinct categories: Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) and Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). The main difference between the two is how the file repository is managed, CVCS using a unique centralized server as its name implies, while DVCS have each user keep a local repository on their computers.[^Zolkifli-VCS]

DVCS are the most commonly used, namely because it allows users to work without network connection, altough uploading and sharing the files requires being online, and the decentralized infrastructure allows for remote work from many different locations. Most systems in this category are free and [open-source](./opensource.md).

Alternatively, CVCS require a constant connection to the server to have access to the project files, and the single connection points means that, should server access be unavailable, work cannot be done and it is possible for changes to be lost. However, it does save space on the programmer's local machine considering they don't need to copy the full code on it, which is useful for complex and heavy projects.[^Gitlab-VCS]

### Examples of version control systems

- Git - DVCS
- Bitbucket - DVCS
- Mercurial - DVCS
- Subversion - CVCS
- Perforce - CVCS

### Alternative names

- Source Code Management (SCM)
- Revision Control Systems (RCS)

## Virtual Environment

Virtual environments are the technology which facilitates interactions between users and computer-generated artificial environments.[^ve3] These interactive computer displays are designed to create the illusion that the user has been transported to a different location.[^ve1] In a virtual world, the user can use their senses and their body in a similar way to the real world. They can turn their head to see their surroundings, trace sounds to the direction they are coming from, and use their hands to pick up virtual objects [^ve2]. Virtual environments are thus the most natural form of interaction between humans and computers.[^ve2]

## Wiki


Wikis are web-based, collaborative software that enables people to modify content by directly editing pages online.[^ebersbach05wiki] In educational contexts, they facilitate student engagement in a collaborative learning environment.[^parker07wiki]

The term "Wiki Wiki Web" was inspired by the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" at Honolulu International Airport, as named by Ward Cunningham.[^anderson10wiki] In Hawaiian, "Wiki" means "quick" or "fast."

Wikis differ from traditional websites in that they are collaborative platforms that allow multiple users to create, edit, and organize content. Unlike traditional websites, wikis enable easy navigation between pages through interlinking and often have features such as revision history and discussion pages to track changes and facilitate communication among users. Wikis are commonly used for knowledge management, project collaboration, and intranet applications, and they can be utilized to display information, store corporate records, or serve as knowledge bases for various subjects. While traditional websites are typically front-end oriented, wikis act as a hybrid between an information system and an information displayer, allowing for quick and easy content creation and updates by users with minimal technical skills.[^hester09analysis]


There are numerous platforms for running wikis. Among the most popular are  [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), and [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#GitHub).
